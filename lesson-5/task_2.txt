Whitney Houston - I Wanna Dance with Somebody

Uh... yeah... woo... hey yeah... huh... hoo yeah... uh huh... yeah...
I want to dance...

Clocks strikes upon the hour and the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out how to chase my blues away
I've done alright up 'til now, it's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls loneliness calls

[Chorus:]
Oh! Wanna dance with somebody, I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! Wanna dance with somebody, with somebody who loves me.
Oh! Wanna dance with somebody, I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! Wanna dance with somebody, with somebody who loves me.

I've been in love and lost my senses spinning through the town
Soon or later the fever ends and I wind up feeling down
I need a man who'll take a chance on a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls, my lonely heart calls

[Chorus:]
Oh! Wanna dance with somebody, I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! Wanna dance with somebody, with somebody who loves me.
Oh! Wanna dance with somebody, I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! Wanna dance with somebody, with somebody who loves me.

Somebody who... Somebody who... somebody who loves me.
Somebody who... Somebody who... to hold me in his arms.

I need a man who'll take a chance, on a love that burns hot enough to last.
So when the night falls, my lonely heart calls.

[Chorus:]
Oh! Wanna dance with somebody, I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! Wanna dance with somebody, with somebody who loves me.
Oh! Wanna dance with somebody, I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! Wanna dance with somebody, with somebody who loves me.

Ooh ooh! Dance! Come on baby.
Dance! Wooo! Yeh! Dance! You dance like this.
Woah! (dance!)

Don't you wanna dance? (dance!) with me baby.
Don't you wanna dance? (dance!) with me boy.
Don't you wanna dance? (dance!) with me baby.
With somebody who loves me.

Don't you wanna dance?
Say you wanna dance.
Don't you wanna dance? (dance!)

Don't you wanna dance?
Say you wanna dance.
Don't you wanna dance? (dance!)

Don't you wanna dance?
Say you wanna dance. (uh huh)(dance!)
With somebody who loves me.
Ooh (dance!)
Ooh-oh (dance!)
Ooh (dance!)
With me baby.
